# Titanic-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
It includes graphical and statistical data analysis of main data related to titanic crash
I have uploaded main CSV file which includes all the data which I have represented in my Exploratory Data Analysis file. My main aim behind doing this was to graphically represent the losses of life happened in this disatarous accident.
And this project is my first step after learning python.
This whole code is written in Anaconda Jupyter Notebook that is why int[] is always appearing in between after every code line.
